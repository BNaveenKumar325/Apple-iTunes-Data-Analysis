This project focuses on analyzing the Apple iTunes music database to generate actionable business insights around customer behavior, music preferences, and operational efficiency. The analysis began with a comprehensive SQL-based data pipeline using normalized datasets provided in CSV format. Tables such as Customers, Employees, Invoices, Tracks, Artists, Albums, Genres, Media Types, and Playlists were imported into a relational database. Relationships were established using primary and foreign keys to form a robust schema.

Using advanced SQL queries involving window functions, subqueries, and CTEs, various business questions were answered. These included identifying top-spending customers, tracking monthly and regional revenue trends, evaluating genre and artist popularity, and segmenting customers based on purchase patterns and retention. Sales performance of employees and underutilized music content were also highlighted through the SQL analytics.

The second phase of the project involved building a multi-page Power BI dashboard with interactive visuals and advanced DAX measures. The dashboard consists of two pages:

Page 1: Customer & Revenue Trends, featuring visuals on top customers, revenue by country, monthly trends, and payment behavior.

Page 2: Music & Genre Insights, covering track sales, artist revenue, genre pricing, and content popularity.

Each visual was developed using specific columns from linked datasets, with a focus on complexity and business relevance. The project concludes with actionable insights to guide strategic decisions in marketing, product development, and operations.
